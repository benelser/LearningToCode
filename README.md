# Learning to Code
This repository is a collection of code that I personally use to reference during my day-to-day life. Coding is something that I find intellectually pleasing. I enjoy learning other languages that I may not otherwise use often, because I find they make me think of new ways of using an old one. 

# MUST READ
This short paper is a great place to start for anyone thinking about learning to code in any language. If you read nothing else on the topic of coding before jumping in, do yourself a favor and take note of the title ["Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years"](http://norvig.com/21-days.html). That is what it is going to take. Find joy in the journey. If learning code isnâ€™t fun for you then find something that is.

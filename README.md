# Learning to Code
This repository is a collection of code that I personally use to reference during my day-to-day life. Coding is something that I find intellectually pleasing. I enjoy learning other languages that I may not otherwise use often, because I find they make me think of new ways of using an old one.

# MUST READ
This short paper is a great place to start for anyone thinking about learning to code in any language. If you read nothing else on the topic of coding before jumping in, do yourself a favor and take note of the title ["Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years"](http://norvig.com/21-days.html). That is what it is going to take. Find joy in the journey. If learning code isn’t fun for you then find something that is.

# A Great Quote on Personal Mastery
*“Personal mastery goes beyond competence and skills, though it is grounded in competence and skills. It goes beyond spiritual unfolding or opening, although it requires spiritual growth. It means approaching one's life as a creative work, living life from a creative as opposed to reactive viewpoint.  When personal mastery becomes a discipline—an activity we integrate into our lives—it embodies two underlying movements. The first is continually clarifying what is important to us…The second is continually learning how to see current reality more clearly."*
<br />    — Peter M. Senge

# A Great Quote on Programming Languages
*"No programming language is perfect. There is not even a single best language; there are only languages well suited or perhaps poorly suited for particular purposes."*
<br />    — Herbert Mayer

# The Greatest Challenge
*"The greatest challenge to any thinker (programmer) is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution."*
<br />  — Bertrand Russell
